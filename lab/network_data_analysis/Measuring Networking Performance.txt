    To measure bandwidth, use the iperf command.
    Measure bandwith between: h1s1 -- h3s1
                              h1s1 -- h3s2
                              h1s1 -- h3s3
    perform the measurement sequentially and record the bandwidth, 
    and then perform the measurement at the same time (parallel).
    you would notice a drop in the bandwidth.

    do the same for the gns3 network.

To measure bandwidth with iperf, 

you'll need to setup 2 hosts on the network.
One would act as a server, and the other would act as the client.

So open up the terminals of any 2 hosts (nodes) you want -- I use x-term to do this, and on one of them run:

" iperf -s -i 1 " -- To set up that host as the server.

then run this iperf command on the client host to maesure bandwidth:

" iperf -c `server-node-ip-address` -d "  ("-d" makes it to run in bi-directinal mode)



Measuring THROUGHPUT with wire shark:

First start up wireshark on your system.
