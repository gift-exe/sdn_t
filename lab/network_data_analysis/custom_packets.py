    To measure bandwidth, use the iperf command.
    Measure bandwith between: h1s1 -- h3s1
                              h1s1 -- h3s2
                              h1s1 -- h3s3
    perform the measurement sequentially and record the bandwidth, 
    and then perform the measurement at the same time (parallel).
    you would notice a drop in the bandwidth.

    do the same for the gns3 network.
